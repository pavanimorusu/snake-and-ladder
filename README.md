# snake-and-ladder
A classic Snake and Ladders game implemented in C language, showcasing core programming concepts like procedural programming, control structures, and modular design. This project simulates the fun and simplicity of the traditional board game in a console-based environment.

🚀 Features
Randomized Dice Rolls: Uses C's random number generation (rand()) to simulate dice rolls.
Dynamic Board Setup: A pre-designed board with snakes and ladders for an interactive gaming experience.
Turn-Based Gameplay: Alternating turns between players, ensuring fairness.
Win-Condition Detection: Automatically determines when a player wins by reaching the final square.
🛠️ Tech Stack
Programming Language: C
Compiler: GCC or any standard C compiler
Development Environment: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS (requires a terminal for execution).
📂 Project Structure
snake_ladders.c: Contains the main game logic, player movement, and board setup.
utils.h/utils.c: Helper functions for dice rolls, game rules, and input validation.
README.md: Project documentation and instructions.
🎯 Purpose
This project was created to:

Demonstrate the use of control structures like loops (for, while) and conditionals (if-else).
Build a modular program with reusable functions for better code organization.
Provide an engaging way to practice logical thinking and game design in C.
